# Eathquake-prediction-model-using-Deep-Learning


**Developed Earthquake Prediction Model:** Engineered an MLP model using Keras and TensorFlow, achieving high accuracy (92.4%) with the best configuration: ReLU activation, SGD optimizer, 16 neurons, 10 epochs, and a batch size of 10.

**Geospatial Data Visualization:** Applied Basemap and Cartopy to create detailed maps of global earthquake data, effectively illustrating affected regions and trends.

**Optimized Model Performance:** Utilized Pandas and Scikit-Learn for data processing and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, resulting in a best cross-validation score of 95.8% with ReLU activation and SGD optimizer.
